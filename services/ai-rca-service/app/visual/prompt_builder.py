Image Prompt Builder — ResolveOps AI.

The prompt is dynamically generated from the spec's components, sections,

Subject:
{spec.title}

Purpose:
{spec.purpose}

Audience:
{spec.audience}

Canvas:
{orientation_rule}

Visual style:
- Modern enterprise architecture diagram style
- Dark navy blue background (#0a0f1e or similar deep dark)
- High-contrast rounded component cards with subtle glow borders
- Indigo and cyan accent colors for boundaries and connectors
- Clean, consistent sans-serif typography (all labels clearly readable)
- Professional, not cartoon-like. Suitable for a technical presentation deck.
- Consistent spacing and alignment throughout

Required sections and boundaries (draw as clearly labelled rounded rectangles):
{sections_text}

Required components (render each as a distinct labelled card inside its section):
{components_text}

Required connections (draw as clean directional arrows with labels):
{relationships_text}

Important components that must be visually prominent:
{important_text}

Layout rules:
- Place components belonging to the same section inside a clearly labelled boundary
- Maintain consistent horizontal and vertical spacing between components
- Arrows must not overlap component labels
- Arrows must not cross unnecessarily; route them cleanly
- Use straight or right-angle connector lines (orthogonal routing preferred)
- Components must not overlap each other
- All component labels must be fully visible and not clipped
- Maintain a clear visual hierarchy from left to right (or top to bottom if portrait)
- Use the full canvas efficiently — avoid large empty areas

Text rules:
- All component names must be spelled exactly as specified above
- Use short labels only — no paragraph text inside the diagram
- Do not place text labels directly on top of connector arrows
- Do not abbreviate component names in ways that change their meaning
- Every named component must have its label visible in the final image

Do not include:
- Generic placeholder boxes labeled "Layer" or "Component" without specific names
- Decorative icons unrelated to the architecture
- Cartoon-style graphics, clip-art, or hand-drawn effects
- Random technical terms not listed in the component list above
- Components or systems not specified in the sections above
- Large solid color blocks without internal content
- Excessive decorative gradients that reduce text readability
- Watermarks or photographer attribution text
